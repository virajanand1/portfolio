                <p>My name is Viraj and I live in Bellevue, Washington. I am 14 years old and I am going to enter 10th grade at Bellevue High School next year. Bellevue is a very beautiful place and its downtown isn't polluted by many problems which is why I love it so much.</p>

                <p>I have a dog, and his name is Milo. Milo is a havanese who recently turned 2 years old. Having Milo during quarantine has made life a lot less boring because of how energetic and joyful he is.</p>

                <p>My favorite thing to do in my free time is spend time with friends. Whether it be in person or online through video games, I love being with them because they always motivate me to try new things with them which I enjoy.</p>
